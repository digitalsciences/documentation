branding:
  # This part is needed for providing individual entry points for all study programs. It was the easiest way
  # to provide this via the localization plugin. The file name denotes the study program: "de.yml" and "en.yml"
  # stand for the Master as the "umbrella", the others (like "dsar.yml", "esar.yml" etc.) for the study programs.
  # As of now, there are only two things that actually are branded: The header color, and the header text.
  header_color: "#eb5a0d"
  header_title: Data and Information Science (DIS)
  header_subtitle: Specialization within Master Digital Sciences
  switch_to_de: "/ddis"
  switch_to_en: "/edis"
