<!-- Learning Outcome -->

Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with techniques that enable computers to understand the meaning of text, which is written in a natural language. Thus NLP constitutes an essential part for modern text-based challenges. As a science NLP can be considered as the field, where Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Linguistics overlap.

NLP enables applications like intelligent search engines, dialog systems, question-answering systems, machine translation, document classification, sentiment analysis or opinion mining.

In this lecture *advanced techniques and theories of NLP* will be taught. However, the lecture does not only provide the theory but also the implementation of the relevant NLP procedures.

<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

The course follows a hybrid format, where lecture videos are provided online and classroom time is used for *discussion*, *exercises*, and working on a *small NLP-related project*.

- This course involves *self-study* (which can be completed online): You're expected to watch the lecture videos, read the corresponding book chapters/sections listed on the last slide of each lecture deck, as well as complete the exercises on GitHub.
- There is also a *classroom* component which is not obligatory, but highly recommended for an optimal learning experience. This involves discussion and exercises in a regular or virtual classroom setting.
