## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.learning_outcome }}
<!-- Learning Outcome -->

In this class fundamental visualization concepts as well as concrete
skills to represent large data sets are taught. Participants will gain
an basic understanding of the physiology of perception and learn to
effectively encode information in figures. Futhermore, they will be
introduced to widely used Python plotting libraries to create figures
based on openly available data sets. After visiting this class
students are able to interprete as well as design figures and are
capable to visualize large data sets.
  
## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.modulecontent }}
<!-- Modulinhalt -->

1. Basics of data visualisation
2. Physiology of perception
3. The grammar of graphics
4. Python based visualisation (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh)

## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.teaching_learning_forms }}
<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

The class will follow a flipped classroom approach and involve
self-studying based on provided reading, audio and video
material. Excersises in which small solution are implemented will help
the participants to explore available tools and help to gain practical
skills for data visualization.
