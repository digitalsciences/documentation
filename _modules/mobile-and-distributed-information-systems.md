<!-- Learning Outcome -->

After finishing this module students will be able to design, to build and to study mobile and distributed systems. They will achieve this goal by

* relating their own challenges to theoretical and conceptional foundations and the state of the art,
* designing distributed systems and software architectures based on appropriate architecture patterns,
* assessing and choosing relevant software and hardware stacks as well as methods and tools,
* implementing their concepts as executable code and deployable systems,
* reflecting on and studying mobile and distributed systems with regard to research and innovation.

This will enable participants to design, build and study mobile and distributed systems. It will empower them to contribute to research and development oriented projects.
