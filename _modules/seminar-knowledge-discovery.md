<!-- Learning Outcome -->
Knowledge Discovery describes the process of automated searches for patterns in large amounts of data that can be regarded as knowledge about the domain and use cases under investigation. These usecases can originate from fields like business, economics, social sciences and many other. Ideally knowledge discovery takes advantage of structured data (e.g. customer data, buying behavior, etc.) but most often only unstructured heterogeneous data is available. Therefore knowledge discovery can be seen as a holistic apporach to generate knowledge from unstructured data and information sources. 

The methods and approaches have evolved from data mining and are closely related to it both methodologically and terminologically. This process generates an abstraction of the input data, which in turn can lead to new data, information and knowledge. 

In this seminar students will work on the most recent trends and topics related to Knowledge Discovery. They will read recent scientific papers in the field to get to know the current state-of-the-art and to learn and practice how to communicate and discuss on these topics.
