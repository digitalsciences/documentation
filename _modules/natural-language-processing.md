<!-- Learning Outcome -->

Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with techniques that enable computers to understand the meaning of text, which is written in a natural language. Thus NLP constitutes an essential part for modern text-based challenges. As a science NLP can be considered as the field, where Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Linguistics overlap.

NLP enables applications like intelligent search engines, dialog systems, question-answering systems, machine translation, document classification, sentiment analysis or opinion mining.

In this lecture the *basic techniques of NLP* will be taught. However, the lecture does not only provide the theory but also the implementation of the relevant NLP procedures.
  
## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.modulecontent }}
<!-- Modulinhalt -->

1. Introduction, show case indexing: thesauri vs. statistical approaches - show, compare and discuss
2. Access text and preprocess (assessing text files, web sites, corpora, segmentation into words and sentences, regex)
3. Morphology (normalisation, stemming, lemmatisation, POS-Tagging ...)
4. Lexical processing (WordNet, DBPedia)
5. Information extraction
6. Classification and Clusterin
7. Evaluation

<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

The course follows a hybrid format, where lecture videos are provided online and classroom time is used for *discussion*, *exercises*, and working on *assignments*.

- This course involves *self-study* (which can be completed online): You're expected to watch the lecture videos, read the corresponding book chapters/sections listed on the last slide of each lecture deck, as well as complete the exercises on GitHub.
- There is also a *classroom* component which is not obligatory, but highly recommended for an optimal learning experience. This involves discussion and exercises in a regular or virtual classroom setting.
