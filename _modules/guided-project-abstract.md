## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.learning_outcome }}
<!-- Learning Outcome -->

Goal is to promote problem-solving skills, self-management skills, teamwork skills, and the ability for independent 
scientific work. The project also serves as intensification of knowledge about the subjects and focus on 
boundaries by practical experience.

  
  
## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.modulecontent }}
<!-- Modulinhalt -->

Supervised work of a complex task in a research and development project (possibly in cooperation with external 
partners) in a team. The Lecturer defines the objectives of the project, and conducts a regular discussion 
on the progress, by means of intermediate meetings between Lecturer and team in intervals of not more than three weeks.
 
In addition, the Lecturer agrees at least two project milestones with the team. The milestone results will 
contribute in an adequate manner to the final grade. The Lecturer further agrees the form of communication and 
cooperation with the team, and reflects it in regular intervals with them. The projects are systematically supervised.

Accompanying these components, the student research the relevant literature independently.


## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.teaching_learning_forms }}
<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

The students work on documentation of the project results, research state of the art technology, use problem-solving
methods etc. 

The overall grade is based on the project results, project report, presentation, and possibly other parts (at 
the discretion of the individual lecturer).
