<!-- Learning Outcome -->

This specialization recaps quickly the machine learning and especially deep learning principles. 
Then the student dives deeper into the following topics

* Advanced methods for attribute selection
* Reinforcement learning
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Special topics such as: 
    * Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
    * Explainable Machine Learning using LIME and ILP approaches

by filling their knowledge gaps between theory and practice while applying the methods in python solving natural language understanding and special computer vision real-world problems for being able to apply modern machine learning methods in enterprises and research and understand the caveats of real-world data and settings.
