                Students learn modelling and optimisation methods that are typically used for solving managerial
                planning and decision problems. They will be able to assess the applicability, usefulness and
                limitations of these methods and develop alternative strategies.

## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.learning_outcome }}
<!-- Learning Outcome -->

1. Students learn modelling and optimisation methods by being introduced to them in the lectures and applying these in practical examples. Such techniques are typically used for solving managerial planning, product, and process desing as well as decision analysis and decision making.
1. Students will be able to assess the applicability, usefulness and limitations of these methods and develop alternative strategies by discussiong these in detail and resoning about improvements.


  
## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.modulecontent }}
<!-- Modulinhalt -->

1. Basic understanding of optimisation problems and how to model these
2. Linear optimisation problems and solving these with the Simplex Algorithm
4. Duality and sensitivity analysis
3. Discrete optimisation problems, typical instances like knapsack as well as TSP, and solving these with the Branch & Bound method
5. Heuristic and meta-heuristic solutions methods and their application
6. Multi-criteria decision analysis and making
