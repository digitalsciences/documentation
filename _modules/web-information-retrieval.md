<!-- Learning Outcome -->

Students learn about the usecase and dimension of web search with a special focus on scientific and academic use
 cases. To understand the issues related to academic search like domain-specific languages, expertise and entities, they implement their own search environment to foster their knowledge and hands-on experiences with the latest Information Retrieval approaches in the field. At the end of the course they know about the issues and solutions that are implemented in big academic search systems like GoogleScholar, PubMed, or arXiv and how the knowledge can be transfered to other domains like enterprise search or expertise retrieval.

<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

The course follows a hybrid format, where lecture videos are provided online and classroom time is used for discussion, exercises, and working on assignments.

- This course involves *self-study* (which can be completed online): You're expected to watch the lecture videos, read the corresponding book chapters/sections listed on the last slide of each lecture deck, as well as complete the exercises on GitHub.
- There is also a *classroom* component which is not obligatory, but highly recommended for an optimal learning experience. This involves discussion and exercises in a regular or virtual classroom setting.
