<!-- Learning Outcome -->

Goal is to promote teamwork skills, self-management skills, problem-solving skills, and the ability for 
understanding team dynamics in order to manage and improve team performance. The project also serves 
as an intensification of knowledge about the subjects 
and focus boundaries by practical experience in heterogeneously composed teams (e.g. culturally diverse teams).

<!-- Modulinhalt -->

Supervised treatment of a complex task in a research and development project (possibly in cooperation with 
external partners) in a team. The Lecturer defines the objectives of the project, and conducts a regular 
discussion on the progress, by means of intermediate meetings between Lecturer and team in intervals of 
not more than three weeks. In addition, the Lecturer agrees at least two project milestones with the team. 
The milestone results will contribute in an adequate manner to the final grade. The Lecturer further agrees 
the form of communication and cooperation with the team, and reflects it in regular intervals with them.

<!-- Lehr- und Lernformen -->

Students can only participate in this module in conjunction with another, "regular" Guided Project 
(GP-ACS, GP-DIP, GP-EB, GP-GAK). Both modules will be coupled in a mandatory fashion. This will be organized 
in roughly the following way:
* The study program manager selects the appropriate Guided Project(s) of type GP-BSS, GP-DIK, GP-DSS, or GP-ST
    to be coupled with this module. This selection can be based on a vote amongst the students, and/or other selection
    criteria.
* If one or several Guided Project(s) have been picked (let's call them `gp1` and `gp2` for the sake of an example), 
    students can participate in `gp1` and `gp2` only in conjunction with _this_ module (GP-TPS). 
* On the other hand, students can participate in _this_ module only if they have enrolled in the associated Guided 
    Projects `gp1` or `gp2`. 

The team processes in the accompanying projects are systematically monitored. Process monitoring combines training and reflection components 
with practical experience and the expansion of the above learning outcomes / skills. It consists of three components, 
as described below.

### Team building and developing sessions

Starting with an introductory workshop to work in (heterogeneous) teams, the intended outcome of the workshop is the team definition, its vision and mission statement (Team Charta). Further sessions follow according to the situational needs of the team development, designed as lectures or further workshop.

The following aspects will be covered:
* characteristics, objectives, advantages and challenges of teamwork
* key findings of group effectiveness research
* Effects of heterogeneity in teams (e.g. inter-cultural, inter-disciplinary, age and gender differences, ...)
* specific requirements, diverse tools and procedures to effectively manage diversity in teams and 
    to achieve innovation and synergy (mapping – bridging  - integrating)
* adapting communication, interaction and management (leadership) style according to phases of team development 
* Procedures for the development of more effective cooperation in heterogeneous project teams.


### Diagnosis and reflection on individual skills and team quality 

This is done in three steps:
* Personality profile (Neo-ffi or similar) is used to investigate the influences on the team dynamics. Potential strengths and weaknesses are discussed and learning and development strategies are identified with the individual team members and the team as a whole.
(NEO-ffi, Inventory of social skills) determines which individual aspects (strengths, weaknesses) 
are brought by the student for teamwork. These results are reported back to the students.
* Individual proclivities and preferences are identified with regard to their effects on team roles by using the Belbin Team Role Inventory; team members are encouraged to broaden their competencies and skills in less preferred roles.
* Team Diagnostics: The quality of work of each team is determined by using procedures of team diagnostics 
(Team Climate Inventory (Brodbeck/Anderson/West) for the measurement of target and task orientation, as well as participation and confidence 
in the team ; SYMLOG-adjective rating scale  (Bales/Cohen) to determine mutual 
interpersonal evaluations of group members). Results are collectively analyzed in a team reflection 
workshop and strategies for change are identified with the group members in terms of improving collaboration in the team and individual learning and optimization opportunities.

### Final Team Reflection Workshop
 
The workshop is designed to review all the steps, decisions and actions taken by the group and to evaluate them with regard to the goals set in the vision statement at the beginning in order to draw lessons learned. 
 Experiences from different teams can be exchanged here, in order to benefit and learn from other groups as well. 

In addition to the above components, students are encouraged to carry out research of relevant literature independently.

### Grading

Students are graded by a written exam (30%). As part the module, the students produce artefacts that also contribute
to their grade, namely a portfolio (written project report (30%) and team charter (10%)) and a presentation (30%).
